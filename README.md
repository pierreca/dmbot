Device Management Bot for Azure IoT Hub

Device Management is a new feature that has just been rolled out.

For the fun of playing with the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) I have created this demo that trains a bot to understand
queries natural language (using the LUIS APIs) to manage different device management tasks.

So far we have: 
- Search for devices by tags and by properties
- Schedule a job such as factory reset, reboot, or firmware update 
- Some basic training for service and device properties

See [TODO](TODO.md) for the list of things I'm working on
